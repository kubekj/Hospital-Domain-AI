problem description:
I would like some python code that can generate a lvl of the following format example I paste below.
I have also written down a bunch of requirements.

The main idea is that it should take a photo.png and generate a lvl that looks like the photo.
It should only use the elements or requirements I've inserted.
More specifically the level has walls (+) and boxes (A-Z), it should not contain any agents.

So please give me some code that can
take as input an image and then generate me a level with the levelname of the photo.
And only use the colors and letters described.

Requirements:
-colors: blue, red, cyan, purple, green, orange, pink, grey, lightblue, brown

- letters: A-Z
- walls: +
- free cells: spaces (ASCII value 32)

- keep 8 letters unused
- Do not use numbers i.e. agents
- A letter can only be assigned 1 color.

Lvl format:
#domain
hospital
#levelname
Kebabs
#colors
green: 0, A, C
brown: 1, B, D
orange: 2, E, F
pink: X
#initial
